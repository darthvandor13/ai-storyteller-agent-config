There, nestled between a willow tree and a crooked fence, was a door. Not on a house, not on a wall—just a freestanding wooden door humming with possibility.\n\nDriven by self-reliance and a thirst for wonder, Calvin turned the knob and stepped through.\n\nThe world on the other side shimmered in pastel hues. Birds whispered riddles, flowers danced in rhythm, and the sky rippled like pond water. “Welcome to the Echoing Garden,” said a talking fox with spectacles, “where every question finds an answer—but only if you ask it the right way.”\n\nCalvin wandered the garden, each step taking him deeper into puzzles and paradoxes. A chessboard forest argued with itself about which direction was forward. A grumpy caterpillar asked him to define “real.” Calvin didn’t know the answers, but he kept moving, thinking, learning.\n\nEventually, he came upon a throne made of mirrors. A queen with two shadows sat upon it. “To rule here,” she said, “you must prove you know who you are—without anyone else telling you.”\n\nCalvin thought of all he’d learned. “I am Calvin. Not because others say it, but because I’ve walked, wondered, and chosen. I’ve made mistakes and kept going. That’s who I am.”\n\nThe queen smiled. “Then you’ve passed.”\n\nWith a flash, Calvin was back in his own world, the mysterious door now gone. He looked around. Same trees. Same path home. But something inside him had changed.\n\nHe no longer feared the unknown."
